Examining if referee bias exists in the modern NBA 

Among some circles, there is a long-standing belief that NBA referees make calls based on personal bias sometimes aimed against teams or specific players. One notorious caseÂ  is Tim Donaghy, the referee responsible for rigging the 2002 playoff matchup between the Sacramento Kings and the Los Angeles Lakers.

However, does referee bias really exist in the modern NBA game? We examined if some teams were more likely to collect personal fouls against using data from the 2014-15, 2015-16, and 2016-17 seasons via NBA.com.
